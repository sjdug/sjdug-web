=== Eventbrite API
To use the Eventbrite API in development you must set the following environment variables:
* EVENTBRITE_APP_KEY
* EVENTBRITE_USER_KEY

They can be acquired by registering for an Eventbrite account.  Set them manually or through dotenv by
creating a .env file at the root of the project.

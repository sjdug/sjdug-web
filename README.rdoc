=== MailChimp API
To use the MailChimp API in development you must set the following environment variables:
* MAILCHIMP_API_KEY
* MAILCHIMP_LIST_ID

They can be acquired by registering for a MailChimp account.  The list id comes from
a created mailing list.  Set them manually or through dotenv by creating a .env file
at the root of the project.
